Today, I set up my git repository and joined my team repository. I was struggling with SSH keys for a bit, but I figured it out eventually. Then, I was struggling with getting the youface website to work with the "python3 youface.py" command, but I asked Ren (he was the substitute) and he helped me with it.

In class we brainstormed ideas for our YouFace social media platform. We wrote all our ideas on sticky notes and then grouped them into app ideas and feature ideas. We came up with some fun ideas like a bipolar social media site that changes the toxicity of the posts you see based on if the app is in light or dark mode. XD There was also an idea for a platform to share art and no AI is allowed.

Last week we did User Stories and added Issues to github for our social media platform. We also edited our requirements documentation a little bit.

We learned how to make a new branch in git and how to push that and merge it with the main branch. We also learned how to deal with conflicting merges which is helpful since there are multiple of us working on the same files. Jeff taught us how to make good flow charts and showed us a good resource to make them in. Using draw.io makes creating flow diagrams easy. I made a flow diagram for following another user for my group's social media platform, Souly.
